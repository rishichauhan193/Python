"""1. Class Performance 2
Problem Description
You have been given a dataset for marks of 2 subjects, scored by students of 
classes ClassA and ClassB. You now want to compare the performances of class 
A and class B by finding out the average performance of the classes. Write a program 
to find if class A performed better. Print True is Class A is strictly better else return 
False.
Input Format
There are 4 lines in the input.
The first and second lines are marks of subjects for Class A.
The third and fourth lines are marks of subjects for Class B.
Output Format
Print True if class A is strictly better else False.

A=int(input("Enter Marks:- "))
B=int(input("Enter Marks:- "))
C=int(input("Enter Marks:- "))
D=int(input("Enter Marks:- "))
print("---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------")
E=int(input("Enter Marks:- "))
F=int(input("Enter Marks:- "))
G=int(input("Enter Marks:- "))
H=int(input("Enter Marks:- "))
classA=A+B+C+D//4
classB=E+F+G+H//4
if(classA>classB):
    print("True")
else:
    print("False")"""

'''3. All correct about x
You have been given the following piece of code. Assume that x has already been 
declared.
if x > 2:
 x = x*2
if x > 4:
 x = 0
print(x)
Select the correct statement regarding this code.

A. Output will always be equal to 0 ------------------------->This Answer is True.
B. If x > 2 and x < 4, final value of x will be double the initial value
C. For x in 0 < x < 4 the output will always be 0
D. For x > 2, output will be equal to 0'''

'''4. If-else output
What will be the output of the following code:
x = 2
if x==2:
 x = 3
x = 4
else:
 x = 5
print(x)
A. 3
B. 4 --------------------->This Answer is True.
C. 5
D. Error'''

'''5. Guide the coordinate
Problem Description
Given the (x, y) coordinates of a point on a 2D plane, write a program that transforms 
these coordinates according to the conditions given below.
• If the sum of x and y coordinates is a multiple of 5, then increment both the 
coordinates by 1 and print.
• If the x coordinate is even and the y coordinate is odd, then increment y by 1 and 
print both.
• If the y coordinate is even and the x coordinate is odd, then increment x by 1 and 
print both.'''
