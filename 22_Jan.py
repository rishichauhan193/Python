# Operators in Python
"""
1. Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %, ** (exponent), // (floor division/integer division)
2. Comparision/Conditional/Relational Operators/Conditions: <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=
    # these operators will always return either True or False
3. Logical Operators: and, or, not
4. Bitwise Operators: &, |, ~, ^ (xor- exclusive or), <<, >>
    3 : 0 0 1 1
        & & & &
    5 : 0 1 0 1

    >>  : 0 0 0 1  1 0 0 1 : 25
    >>  : 0 0 0 0  1 1 0 0 : 12
5. Assignment Operators: 
    =
    a = 5
    shorthand operators:
    a = a + b   : a += b
    a = a - b   : a -= b
    a = a * b   : a *= b
    a = a / b   : a /= b
    a = a % b   : a %= b
    a = a ** b  : a **= b
    a = a // b  : a //= b
    a = a & b   : a &= b
    a = a | b   : a |= b
    a = a ^ b   : a ^= b
    a = a << 3  : a <<= b
    a = a >> 3  : a >>= b
    There is no such thing as i++ or i-- in Python, so we have to write i += 1 or i -= 1.
6. Membership Operators: in, not in
7. Identity Operators: is, is not
