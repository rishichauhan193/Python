1. Remaining Bake Time
    Problem Description:
    You're going to write some code to help you cook a gorgeous lasagna from your favorite cookbook. According to your cookbook, the Lasagna should be in the oven for 40 minutes. Given the time (in minutes), the lasagna has been in the oven, find how many more minutes the lasagna still needs to bake for.
    Problem Constraints
    0 <= N <= 40
    Input Format:
    The only first line contains the integer N, denoting the actual time (in minutes) the lasagna has been in the oven for.
    Output Format:
    Print in a single line how many minutes the lasagna needs to bake.
    Examples
    Input: 
    30
    Output: 
    10
    Example Explanation
    Note: The problem constraints mean that when we test your code, the test cases used in the backend can have input values only within those constraints.You need not implement them in your code.
    You need to make sure your code will work for all such input values!

2. Preparation Time
    Problem Description:
    You'll write some code to help you cook a gorgeous lasagna from your favorite cookbook. Now, you also want to add a few layers to the lasagna. Assume **each layer takes 2 minutes** to prepare. Given the number of layers you want to add to the lasagna, find how many minutes you would spend making them.
    Input Format:
    The only first line contains the integer N denoting the number of layers.
    Output Format:
    Print in a single line how many minutes are required to prepare N layers.

3. Total Elapsed Cooking Time
    Problem Description:
    You wrote some code to help you cook a gorgeous lasagna from your favorite cookbook. Now, you want to find the total number of minutes you've been cooking for the sum of your preparation time and the time the lasagna has already spent baking in the oven. The preparation time of one layer is 2 minutes. Given the number of layers added to the lasagna and the number of minutes the lasagna has been baking in the oven, find the total elapsed cooking time (prep + bake) in minutes.
    Problem Constraints:
